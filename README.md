# Planning Phase

1. Requirements Analysis and Validation:

- Review and Categorize: Organize the extracted requirements and constraints into functional and non-functional categories. This helps in understanding the scope of features and system behavior.
- Validate with Client: Confirm the requirements with the client to ensure there's a mutual understanding of what needs to be developed. This step may involve a series of meetings or communications to refine and approve the requirements.

2. Project Planning:

- Define Milestones: Establish key milestones and timelines based on the requirements. This should include major phases like design, development, testing, and deployment.
- Resource Allocation: Plan the allocation of resources, including team members, tools, and technology. Ensure you have the necessary skill sets available for different aspects of the project.
- Risk Assessment: Identify potential risks associated with the project timeline, technical challenges, and resource constraints. Develop mitigation strategies for identified risks.

3. System Design:

- Architectural Design: Design the system architecture that includes defining the software, hardware, and network requirements necessary to fulfill the technical and operational requirements.
- User Interface Design: Create initial wireframes and mockups based on user experience and design preferences. These should be reviewed and iteratively refined with feedback from the client.
- Database and System Integration Design: Plan the data architecture and integration requirements with existing client systems, if applicable.

4. Prototype Development:

- Build MVP: Develop a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that includes the core functionality necessary to meet the most critical project objectives and requirements.
- Internal Testing: Conduct thorough testing to ensure the MVP meets the functional requirements and adheres to the non-functional standards set out in the planning phase.

5. Client Review and Feedback:

- Demonstrate MVP: Present the MVP to the client, demonstrating the key functionalities and the user interface.
- Collect Feedback: Obtain detailed feedback from the client, including what aspects meet their expectations and what needs adjustment.
- Iterate Based on Feedback: Make necessary changes based on the clientâ€™s feedback to refine the product.

6. Prepare for Full-Scale Development:

- Finalize Requirements and Design: After refining the prototype, finalize the requirements and complete the design documents.
- Set Up Development Environment: Ensure that the development environment is fully set up for the team, including code repositories, development tools, and staging areas.

7. Kickoff:

- Project Kickoff Meeting: Hold a kickoff meeting with the entire project team to discuss the project plan, timelines, responsibilities, and communication protocols.
- Start Development: Begin the development phase according to the project plan, applying agile methodologies for iterative development and continuous integration.
