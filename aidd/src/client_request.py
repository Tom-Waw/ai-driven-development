The project is a Python application built with FastAPI that provides an API for users to send JSON data.
When data is submitted, it is stored in a text file, and the API responds with an ID corresponding to the entry.
The application includes all standard CRUD operations, allowing users to create new entries,
retrieve data by ID, update existing entries, and delete entries.
Data management is handled through basic file operations on the text file storing the JSON entries."""
