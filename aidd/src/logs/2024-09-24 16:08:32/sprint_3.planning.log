The project was successfully implemented. The client is very happy. He has a new requirement we have to integrate into the system. There are Games that the user can potentially play. A Game is defined with a name and a necessary age to play it. The client defines a fixed list of games and wants to have another api to test if a user given by id can play that game given by name. Remind the development team that there should be a new module for the new api as it is very different from the rest. Provide them in the Game ticket also with the fixed list (Pokebeasts age 6, Heat Age age 6, Call of War age 18). The description of the ticket must be clear to understand.
